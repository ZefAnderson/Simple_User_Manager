# Simple_User_Manager
Create a Simple User Manager (no Angular). 
One view should be the form that creates new users. 
The form should create a user with the following attributes:
Username, name, email address, age
Your server should then assign a unique userId to this user upon creation.
Post the newly created user to the server and save it to a file, then redirect the client to the user listing view.
One view should be the user listing.
t should contain a table which should list the username, name, email address, and age of all created users, as well as an edit and delete button/link for each user
The edit link should take you to the edit view for that user
The delete link should delete the user
One view should be an edit view.
This view should contain a form similar to the create user form but that is pre-populated with the users information, and allows for editing of the correct users information.
